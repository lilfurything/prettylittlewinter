i just wanna do this stuff all the time, it blows going to work after having such a creative weekend<br>
      <br>
i haven't done too much music recently but ive been finding my direction of stuff i like to make<br>
and now i just make whatever i like, making things for yourself it the mooooove<br>
and making cool shit in blender is awesome<br>
      <br>
idk what else is goin on, work is better but still tense, but now im just looking at it like<br>
i dont really care and i just do my job and make my money, no need to be tweaking<br>
i must be on estrogen the way my racks growing<br>
      <br>
right now my mind is peak coolin, i am in a flow state of creative energy and i will act on my urges to create<br>

fuk the adderall shortage for real<br>
i also dont really like my psychiatrist she gives me weird vibes<br>
i should probably discuss being trans and being on hrt to her but she seems lowkey transphobic idk<br>
i feel like u shouldn't be able to be a doctor if ur transphobic or homophobic lol just saying<br>
      <br>
i am also not happy with my work situation<br>
no one is right now and the office has a terrible vibe.<br>
my coworkers are mad at my manager and rightfully so<br>
he kinda just gives everyone else his work to do and its pretty shitty.<br>
i tend to just keep my head down and get my work done<br>
which kinda fuckin sucks lol, i do not feel like i am connected to my work like anyone else is<br>
but yeah my manager is kinda not good at his job and everyone wants to leave and it just<br>
stresses me out a lot, even though its not really my problem<br>
i also cant deal with the hours i work any more<br>
getting home at 9:30 just doesn't work for me, i miss sydney so much<br>
i have hung out with syd maybe 3 or 4 times this month<br>
that is insane<br>
i really miss my unemployed era where i just hung out with syd every day lol<br>
i have been thinking about going back to college for computer science<br>
and working at starbucks for the ffs insurance lol<br>
maybe ...<br>

my mind has been switched to creative mode<br>
now i have infinite redstone and the mob spawner eggs<br>
so maybe i will build a sethbling automatic piston door in my bedroom<br>
      <br>
i cut my bangs the other day and am back to peak mental performance<br>
      <br>
my brain completely threw out the idea of making demos for anything<br>
i tried the longest to make a final product from the start<br>
totally skipped every step to refining something i want to be good<br>
so now the workflow is:<br>
laptop demo ----&gt;&gt; 8 track final project<br>
after seeing king gizz i entered my jam mode and now i just wanna write jam licks<br>
might be awesome but idk<br>
      <br>
it is officially one month of this blog and i am very infrequent with my updates,,<br>
i apologize! jk this blog is actually just really chill, one day it will be on the front page of google<br>
and every kid in their fourth grade typing class will visit<br>
and become really inspired<br>

and the song is so good, it is hilarious<br>
on saturday i bought the new zelda game and now im gonna go back to the gamestop and tell them they changed my life<br>

      <br>
i made some great purchases this weekend<br>
besides zelda, i got two new disc golf discs and the new putter i bought is killer<br>

almost the weekend wooooo<br>
i am going to hang out with my friend and record some music tomorrow<br>
i am totally up way too late right now though i have got to work earlyyyy tmrw<br>
workk has been so goofy i kinda have a weird vibe about like jobs in general<br>
i am so quiet at work like i really keep to myself but i think i do enjoy being real with my coworkers<br>
they can totally be chill im just like way younger than everyone there so its a little goofy<br>
but its been pretty chill<br>
i had someone come in to record a song and it was called space warfare and it was about<br>
jesus beating up the devil in space<br>
and there was a bar about punching the devil in the </span><span style="color: rgb(251, 253, 252);" role="heading" aria-level="1" class="yKMVIe">esophagus and giving him asthma<br>
it was hilarious i am still thinking about how good it was<br>
      <br>
      <span style="color: rgb(251, 253, 252);">i like to keep quiet about things i do but sometimes i just start blabbing at work !<br>
i want to just do my things and not tell anyone L O L<br>
idk if that is just like me being weird<br>
i think if people say the things i do are good then im like sweet this is good enough then ! i do not push the limit<br>
that aint good !!!<br>
so i am going to just work on projects in secret and then one day&nbsp; reveal it all and be like check it out<br>
i do not plan on showing anyone this website, at least not until there is a lot of posts that would be so sweet to<br>
have my secret archive of brain flow</span><br>

this is my first entry on the site which is pretty cool, maybe i will
make it blog style<br>
or maybe like a diary idk :0<br>
but i dont have anything too interesting to put for an entry right now,<br>
i would love to work on a song this week, i am going to hang out with
my friend friday<br>
and maybe we will record a song<br>
      <br>
i am setting a goal to seperate work brain from home brain<br>
they need to be two completely seperate entities, though work brain can
borrow<br>
from my home brain but never vice versa<br>
if i could come home from work and feel completely detatched from the
day i had<br>
wooooooo<br>
that would be perfect<br>
so that is what i am planning on doing, going home and having something
to do<br>
that doesn't involve work, or stress, or makes me feel bad<br>
      <br>
i wanna skateboard more but i get home so late !<br>
i gotta skate my new curb / rail i built, i want to get really good
